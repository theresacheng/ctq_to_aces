# ctq_to_aces

Takes data from subjects that completed both the CTQ and ACE surveys from a study by Teicher and Parriger (2015). These data were shared with us directly and are not publically available. 

The data were re-formatted into a long tidy dataframe with the following fields: subject_id, item, score.
